# arch-sysup
GUI System Update Tool for Arch Linux.  Yay/Paru is detected and will update aur packages.
I relied heavily on Claude and Gemini to make this as I am not a programmer.  I just wanted to have fun and make something useful for myself.  :)

#Installation
1) Create new directory to avoid polluting your home directory
2) Download PKGBUILD into the new directory
3) Open terminal and cd into the new directory
4) Type 'makepkg -si' and enter sudo password when prompted

A desktop file is created so it will show up in launchers
